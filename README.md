# open-policy-registry

As a part of a grant from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, Creative Commons will overhaul our OER Policy Registry (https://wiki.creativecommons.org/OER_Policy_Registry) and combine it with other catalogs to create a single, one-stop, global Open Policy Registry hosted under the umbrella of the Open Policy Network. The Registry will be designed so that additional policies can be added/edited by any OPN member. We’ll work with existing policy registries in related areas, such as POERUP (http://poerup.referata.com/wiki/Main_Page), Civic Commons (http://wiki.civiccommons.org/Open_Data_Policy), and others in order to ingest data or otherwise display relevant policies without reinventing the wheel.

Collecting, reviewing, and highlighting the world’s open policies is a core and ongoing activity of OPN. As open policies emerge, the Open Policy Registry will record them and provide analysis on which open policies meet the best practices as recommended by the Open Policy Network. New CC tech staff will provide technical support for this deliverable including development, hosting, and maintenance.
